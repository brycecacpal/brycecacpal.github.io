                    <p>Writing Skills: When I first learned to code a website, we were required to code a portfolio from scratch and use the knowledge from each unit we did. This used a lot of my writing skill because much like this portfolio, I had to write about what I learned in each unit of web development. Not only did I get to write about what I learned in detail, but I also learned how to write and organize my HTML and CSS code, which is important when making any website.</p>

                    <p>Content Knowledge: This project was the most stressful project I did in my sophomore year. My sophomore class was asked to create a website about Shakespeare for one of the 10th grade English teachers at our school. Not only did we have to create the design of the website, but we also had to do the research on Shakespeare to put information on the site. Although it was very stressful and took a lot of time, I liked the project because it allowed me to use all of the skills that I learned in web design and apply them to a real situation.</p>

                    <p>Presentation Skills: The 2014 Girls in Tech conference this year was very unique and fun. My project group and I got the opportunity to teach middle school girls about an app known as Stop Motion Studio, where you can create animations by taking consecutive pictures using your phone or tablet. This conference really depended on presentation skills, and how well you can convey information to a group of people. As for myself, I had to make sure that I was loud and clear, and that everything that I was telling them was correct and didn't confuse them too much.</p>

                    <p>Teamwork and Collaboration: This PBL was my favorite PBL because I got to use all of my skills from animation and design, and apply them to a real situation for a good cause. Our job was to make an animation adaptation for a children's book written by Benjamin Nelson, an artist with autism. Making the adaptation to Ben's book tested my teamwork and collaboration skills because the sophomore class was split up into sections to work on certain parts of the animation, and we all had to work together to get a page done. For many instances, students had to help out other students, and sometimes even animate a whole page by themselves. This PBL was very stressful, but it was worth it in the end, and the animation turned out beautiful.</p>

                    <p>Use of Resources: Our sophomore class had to design QR codes for other teachers, so that parents and students could easily access information about the teacher and the class. I consider this a use of resources because we had to use not just the computer to generate the code, but we also had to use our smart phones and tablets to test the codes and make sure they worked. We also had to use other forms of technology like cameras and video editing to inform new students and parents about a certain teacher and their class.</p>

                    <p>Work Ethic: The students in my graphic design class were tasked to create logos that represented who we are and what we do. I wanted my logo to have a meaning, even if it was a small one. With this assignment, I was constantly turning in new versions of the logos and I also had to turn in sketches and do progress checks.</p>

                    <p>Content Knowledge: The students in web design created websites for real clients. For my client, I chose my cousin Aaron Ugale, who is a photographer that needed a personal portfolio. We used our knowledge of basic HTML, CSS, Javascript, and PHP to create fully functional website for a client of our choice. Along with the use of our basic code, we also had to utilize media queries to allow the site to be responsive across all platforms, whether it be mobil or desktop. Since we were designing for mobile as well, I designed my client's website from mobile first. I also incorporated the use of DropBox to make it easier for the client to upload his photos to the site.</p>

                    <p>Teamwork and Collaboration: This PBL was for U.S. History and English, and the objective was to create a music video that discusses a topic in history while incorporating poetic devices and figurative language. This project was stressful because it was assigned to me in a time where I had no time. I managed to pull through with the help of my team members to create this video about the Cuban Missile Crisis. I edited and filmed the whole video and produced the music, and I used Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, Premiere Pro, and After Effects to edit it. I also learned a couple green screen tricks!</p>

                    <p>Use of Resources: This Spring PBL was the project that proved that projects can be fun. For the first day of the PBL, we had to use our existing knowledge and other resources such as our phones and other forms of technology to solve different problems throughout the school. On the second day, we had to create a presentation based on what we did the previous day, and we had to discuss how we used 21st century skills to complete our tasks. My group decided to put me on the spot! I played the guitar and we sang a parody of Taylor Swift's "You Belong With Me" about the 21st century skills that we used.</p>

                    <p>Presentation Skills: In graphic design, Mrs.Clark gave us an art festival poster contest as an assignment, and we had to create a poster for Brian Head, Utah. I liked this assignment because we had the freedom to design however we wanted, and there wasn't much content, so we could focus more on the design aspect of the poster. This assignment falls under the category of "Presentation Skills" because even though we didn't present the poster to someone, we submitted it for the contest and recieved positive and negative feedback, all for constructive critism so that we can better our results, just the same as if we had actually presented in front of somebody.</p>

                    <p>Work Ethic: There was a long development process for this assignment. In graphic design, we were tasked to create sketchbook themes and explore them through different exploration exercises to find a concentration for our final piece. My final piece is based on the possibilities of different planet textures and what types of undiscovered elements there could be in space. For the name "Last Orange", it is based on the name of my favorite band which is Last Dinosaurs. Last Dinosaurs signifies the last of the original indie-rock bands in the Brisbane, Australia music scene, and I wanted my orange to relate to this because the last planet in the universe could be anything as simple as an orange.</p>

                    <p>Writing Skills: For this PBL, we had to create a website to explain a physics concept. Our physics concept was centripetal force, and my group decided to represent centripetal force with a headspin. I wasn't tasked to make the actual website, but my job was to create the video to explain the physics concepts behind a headspin and to also learn how to do the headspin, because at the time, I didn't know how to do that move. It involved a lot of research and actual writing because I wasn't in physics at the time, so I had to teach myself the physics concepts and try to explain them as best as I could. I was sick too! I don't recommend spinning on your head when you have the flu.</p>

                    <p>Work Ethic: This assignment falls into the category of work ethic because of the amount of times we had to submit a screenshot to show our progress. We had to watch a tutorial on Lynda.com to create this Chinese chop design, except with our names. I was frustrated at first because I followed the tutorial about 75% through, not knowing that we had to complete the Chinese chop design with our own name.</p>
